# Reverse Linked List

## Problem Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

## Example 1:

![Example 1](./image_1-reverse_linked_list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

## Example 2:

![Example 2](./image_2-reverse_linked_list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

_Follow-up Question:_ A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
